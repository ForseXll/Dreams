Advanced React Course Practice

This Project was done by following Advanced React course from WesBos. All the work was done by myself. I used his CSS and styles, and shop concept. 
This is my first react project with any API or database. 

In this course I use React with next.js and styled components for interface.

Used Apollo Client to perform mutation, queries, caching managing local states and dealing with loading and errors.

Used GraphQl-Yoga for implementation of the mutations and queries. It was also used for credit card, email and authentications.

Prima was used for relationship between data, and use of it's API.
