Advanced React Course Practice

This Project was done by following Advanced React course from WesBos. All the work was done by myself. I took a lot of his CSS and styles, and shop concept. 
This is my first react project with any API or database. 

In this course I use React with next.js and styled components for interface.
I used Appolocclient to perfomr mutation, queries, caching managin local state and deaing with loading and errors.
I used GraphQlYoga for implementation of the mutations and queries. It was also used for creditcard, email and authentications.
Prima was used for relationship between data, and use of it's API.
